# ParsingTextFile
This is a training project to help get some experience with C#. Specifically how to leverage StreamReader to parse through txt documents.
This will take a txt document, read each line into a List, split the List into two using the "RESULTS_DATA" as the line of demarkation, normalize the data, and output the data in a requested format in two text files.

Feedback or collaboration is always appreciated.
